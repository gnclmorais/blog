Hi there!

I’m Gonçalo, a computer engineer turned web developer, and this is my blog.

After reading posts & posts about why you should write, no matter if you think your experience is not enought or not relevant for other people, I decided to finally setting up my writer’s corner. People all over the web I admire convinced me to do it, [push](https://news.layervault.com/stories/42675-fear-of-writing) by [push](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/noah-stokes/2015-january-25) by [push](http://seanwes.com/podcast/139-it-all-starts-with-writing-again/).

So, picking up [Ghost](https://ghost.org) and developing my own (simple) theme were the first steps taken to make this a real thing. So a few details about that:

- [Ghost](https://ghost.org) is a new & shiny blogging platform, and I’m fond of it mainly because of its content focus.
- More than employing an already existing Ghost theme, I wanted to build my own and use it as a test bed for applying tools, benchmarks and improvements I might found interesting to play with. So [this theme](https://github.com/gnclmorais/Noir) is very much _not_ optimised on purpose, so I can fiddle with it and write here about it.

Outside this blog, you can find me virtually everywhere. The main places are [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gnclmorais), [GitHub](https://github.com/gnclmorais) & [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/gnclmorais) for cool, techy stuff, and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/gnclmorais) & [Spotify](https://play.spotify.com/user/gnclmorais) for more personal stuff. Enjoy!

P.S.: This post’s title is an [_homage_](http://christianheilmann.com/2005/01/27/blogs-away/) to [Christian Heilmann](https://twitter.com/codepo8), in an attempt to avoid the ever so classic [“Hello world!”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program).

## Update
I recently moved my blog from Ghost + DigitalOcean to Jekyll + GitHub Pages. Why, you ask? Simply because I’m a cheapskate and I like free stuff.  
Now for real, I really like Ghost, but for the uses I’m giving to my blog, a (free) static platform is more than enough.
