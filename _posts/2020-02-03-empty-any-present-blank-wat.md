Iâ€™ve recently wrote an article for my [companyâ€™s blog](https://bridge-u.dev) â€” our first one! Itâ€™s about Ruby on Railsâ€™s method to check if a collection is empty or not. Some of these methods come from Ruby, some exclusively from Rails, and we dive a bit on the subtle differences between them. You can read it in its full length [here](https://bridge-u.dev/empty-any-present-blank-wat). ðŸ’Ž Enjoy!
