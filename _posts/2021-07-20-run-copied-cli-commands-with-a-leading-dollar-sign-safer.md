I recently came across [Stefanâ€™s tip](https://www.stefanjudis.com/blog/how-to-run-commands-with-a-leading-usd-sign) on how to run copied commands with a leading dollar sign and I thought it was a great idea! However, this heads-up caught my eye:

> Use at your own risk. ðŸ¤“ Before implementing any functionality that makes running copied code easier, be aware that the internet's a bad place. There's always a chance that a command has malicious intent or [even includes hidden commands](http://thejh.net/misc/website-terminal-copy-paste).

This made me think: maybe I can build upon his example and add a small layer of protection, to prevent accidental errors when working a bit absentmindedly â€” we all do that from time to time.


## Ask for confirmation before

Follow his tutorial and, when you get to the part when youâ€™re writing the script, instead of simply executing the commands it gets, ask the user for _explicit_ confirmation before proceeding. Use this as the content of your `$` executable:

```bash
#!/bin/zsh
read -p "Are you sure you? [y/N]: " -n 1 -r
echo # move to a new line
if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]
then
    exec "$@"
fi
```

I [used someoneâ€™s else suggestion](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1885534/590525) in order to ask for confirmation, but this is a simple way of adding a small confirmation step. Anything that is not `y` or `Y` will skip the execution. This will hopefully help with the [hidden commands issue](http://thejh.net/misc/website-terminal-copy-paste) Stefan made me aware of.
