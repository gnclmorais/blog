A few months ago, after learning about the death of [Jean E. Sammet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_E._Sammet), I realised that there is this huge amount of personalities that pushed the field of Computer Science and that, even though I went through a masterâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering, I still didnâ€™t know who most of them wereâ€¦

This gave me an idea for a project. A short newsletter (with an RSS feed as well, for people with _email fatigue_) that, every fortnight or so, would introduce you to someone that (in some way) propelled Computer Science forward, someone you should know a little about.

This eventually led me to [**Heroes of Computer Science**](heroesofcomputer.science) and Iâ€™ve sent three issues so far: [Ada Lovelace](https://www.heroesofcomputer.science/issues/heroes-of-computer-science-issue-1-499264), [Grace Hopper](https://www.heroesofcomputer.science/issues/heroes-of-computer-science-issue-2-567730) and [Alonzo Church](https://www.heroesofcomputer.science/issues/heroes-of-computer-science-issue-3-578033).

I have many more people to go through, but so far, Iâ€™m really enjoying discovering about new personalities and re-learning about names I already knew about but not that well.

If you have a suggestion for someone to be spotlighted on this project, let mw know through [this simple form](https://airtable.com/shrzC1ttxMN9cdXFI)! Iâ€™d love to get more ideas for future issues. ðŸ¤©
