Since I’ve already talked about [syntax highlighting on this blog](http://gnclmorais.com/blog/adding-syntax-highlight-to-ghost/), I might as well give you a piece of my mind concerning a few of my preferences on this subject.

I’ve been increasingly drawn to lighter colour themes, I’ve noticed they ease long periods of staring into these bright windows we call _monitors_. I’ve started with light characters on top of very dark backgrounds (as I guess 99% of all developers did), but these past couple of years my offices have been so sunny & bright that switching to colour themes that minimise the contrast between them and the room’s background have increased my happiness for sure (and my productivity as well - who knows?).

However, there is not much love for light themes. They are not as popular, not as well crafted as dark themes, and people usually overlook them. I don’t get exactly why, but I’ve been preaching the advantages of brighter colour schemes for months now. So, for future reference (yours, and mine as well), here are my __my favourite light themes for Sublime Text__:

## [Piatto](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Piatto)

## [Solarized](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Solarized%20Space)

## [Spacegray](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Spacegray)

Some of these colour schemes also bring UI themes, so check them out as well! The one I’m using came with Piatto (also light, _Piatto Light 3.sublime-theme_).

__P.S.:__ As a front-end developer, I mostly focus on JavaScript, so my main focus of this list was _”Does JavaScript look good with this theme?”_
