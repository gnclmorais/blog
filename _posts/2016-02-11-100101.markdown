Following the example of a [few](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/535) [good](http://redlua.com/post/100-10-1/) [friends](http://kamalmarhubi.com/blog/2016/01/25/100-10-1/), I decided to joined them on a [100:10:1](http://blog.fogus.me/2015/11/04/the-100101-method-my-approach-to-open-source/) project. Simply put: write down 100 ideas (anything you would like to do, anything wild), them pick 10 of them up to build MVPs (you can/should work on them concurrently), and choose one of those ideas into a legitimate release.

I felt this initiative played really well with another quest I took in January: planning the whole year by weeks and [open sourcing my goals](https://github.com/gnclmorais/personal-goals) (inspired by [Una’s project](https://github.com/una/personal-goals)). I pretty sure this will help me to nail down a few finished projects. So, without further ado, here are the 100 (unreviewed) ideas I was able to gather:
