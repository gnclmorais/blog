Short paragraph, just to see how it looks.

[Links](http://google.com) are cool too!

This is __bold__ and this is _italic_. Sweet! You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many [different ways](http://dribbble.com), but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

This is a list, btw:

- One item
- Two items
- Adventure Time!
- Three times

## h2 title
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

### h3 title
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

#### h4 title

I also have images in this article. Here’s a simple one:

![Adventure Time with Finn and Jake](http://www.pixelstalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Adventure-Time-Background-HD.jpg)

And now a fullscreen one! :D
