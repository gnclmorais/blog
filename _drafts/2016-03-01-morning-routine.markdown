I’ve recently noticed that being part of [**Recurse Center**](https://recurse.com/apply) brings an unexpected perk, one that I can finally put into words. When you see so many great people coding & writing interesting stuff, you draw some excitement and encouragement out of it. It’s some sort of **unintentional, passive, benigne peer pressure**.

After reading [quite](http://simplyahmazing.github.io/writing/meta/2015/05/12/morning-routine.html) [a](https://writing.natwelch.com/post/538) [few](https://lunacodes.wordpress.com/2016/02/27/organizing-chaos/) blog posts about morning routines (something I’m increasingly fascinated by), I decided to write my own, describing the current ritual I hone. This is a work in progress, and it only describes my daily routine in London – because when I travelling, it is _completely_ thrown out of the window.

1. __6h00: wake up__
Waking up quite early has provided me invaluable ease of mind and a constant flow of productive/creative time. Getting home after an 8h job and trying to do something productive/creative doesn’t work for me, I’m already out of stamina.
1. __6h00 - 6h10: browse social networks__
I admit this is not the most productive or healthy activity I could do, but the way I have my Facebook and Instagram customised brings me a good ratio of useful updates on a few friends, good information about my interests, and a dash of creativity (mostly from Instagram). I hope I’ll be able to replace this bit with something less passive in the future.
1. __6h10 - 6h30: practice a language on [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com)__
Given my current trip to South America, I’m currently practicing Spanish. As a native Portuguese speaker, it has been easy as a breeze. We share the same language base and most of the vocabulary.
1. __6h30 - 7h00: do a few pushups, stretch, meditate__
This is mostly a gentle nudge to my body, telling it that sleep is definitely over. It also helps to keep at bay any morning angst i usually feel.
1. __7h00 - 7h30: run at least 5k__
I try to do this once every two days, so I end up running 3 to 4 times each week. On days I don’t run, I just go straight to…
1. __7h30 - 8h00: shower, breakfast, and coffee__
It’s almost 8h and you already did quite a lot, so a good breakfast is required (usually eggs with a lot of vegetables). After it, a cup of amazing [Pact coffee](http://pactcoffee.com/?voucher=GNCLMORAIS@tw) brewed with my Aeropress will fuel me while I…
1. __8h00 - 9h30: work on side projects__
This time block means literally anything I might have to work on: writing, designing, coding, brainstorming, email catching up… Anything productive, really. These past two months have been mostly to brainstorm talks I might be able to do in JavaScript or CSS conferences. However, with my recent plan of joining the [100:10:1](http://gnclmorais.com/blog/100101/) effort, I’ll start converging more & more into planning and codding of the [10 ideas](http://gnclmorais.com/blog/100101-part-ii/) I picked.
1. __9h30-10h00: commute__
Finally, my personal morning comes to an end, as my professional one fades in. I’ve had the pleasure of being able to walk to work in the past 7 months. However, I’ll soon have to get the tube again, as we moved offices. Less walking time will mean more reading time, so I guess it balances out.
