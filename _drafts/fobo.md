I frequently catch myself thinking “I love being a developer.” After nearly a decade of being paid to solve problems with code, I enjoy it way more than when I first picked this at university.

Whenever my friends complaint about their careers, that they are trying to change jobs but the market is not good, I half-jokingly say “Have you thought about becoming a developer?”
