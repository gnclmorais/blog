Now that I’m back to my Londoner routine, I feel ready to change gears on this project and start doing some modest, but [constant progress](http://carlosd.ghost.io/one-year/).

So, starting from now, I will start doing weekly updates to my current projects. I’ll only abstain from them if a week was exceptionally slow/busy and I didn’t get to touch on code at all.

## Stuff I worked on:
#### project 1…
qwerty

## Stuff I didn’t worked on:
#### project 1…
qwerty
